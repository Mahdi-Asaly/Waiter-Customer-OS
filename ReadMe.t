* Introduction
A new fast food restaurant in Tel Aviv would like you to create a simulation program of its
work. It will have a new interactive menu. A number of waiters work in the restaurant. Customers
can “come” to the restaurant and check the list of dishes, and order a certain amount
of the item they want.
